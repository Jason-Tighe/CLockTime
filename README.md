# CLockTime
Created with CodeSandbox


#Purpose.
I've found it annoying to loop up time conversions online, so I figured I'd take a stab at creating a clock with timezones that the user can select and then add an option to compare.

I've brought in a library of everytimezone, however, it's created a conflicting issue with timezone's that are registered as a valid. I'll have to work around this.


I need to think of a better solution than just 2 different states, right?

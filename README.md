# CLockTime
Created with CodeSandbox


#Purpose.
I've found it annoying to loop up time conversions online, so I figured I'd take a stab at creating a clock with timezones that the user can select and then add an option to compare.

I've brought in a library of everytimezone, however, it's created a conflicting issue with timezone's that are registered as a valid. I'll have to work around this.


I need to think of a better solution than just 2 different states, right?
figured this out, jsut need to clean up code and stlye and move from codesandbox to a regular repo

fixed the issue with getting the UTC time by itself and found a way to use the "offSet" so that I wouldn't have to worry about "nonvaild" timezones when using ".tolocalstring".
Another day another edit!
conflicted, i might scrap and restart.
I want to figure out how to create a slider but as a circle? like a hand on a clock.
